## 🗺️ Dashboard Highlights

### 🌎 Geographic View (Sales by State)
- California, New York, and Texas dominate sales volumes; midwestern states lag.
- Western and southern states show strong growth pockets, but profits aren’t always aligned with high sales.
- Management opportunity: target underperforming but populous states with marketing or stock adjustments.

### 📅 Time Series (Order Date)
- Sales grow year-over-year from 2014–2017 with December peaks every year.
- Profits rise too but flatten in heavy-discount months — revenue up faster than profit.
- Key insight: discounts boost volume but compress margins; worth revisiting pricing strategy.

### 🥧 Category Performance (Sales, Profit, Discount)
- Technology leads 2017 sales; Office Supplies is close; Furniture lags.
- Profit margins: Technology highest; Furniture lowest despite decent sales.
- Discounts: Office Supplies gets steepest cuts, fueling volume but hurting profit.

### 📦 Profit & Discount Distribution
- Most transactions cluster around low profit bins, a few high-profit outliers.
- Heavy discounts (20–40%) correlate with spikes in sales but much lower profits.
- Key insight: a controlled discount strategy could improve overall profitability.

### 🔄 Interactive Filters
- Year selector (2014–2017).
- Month selector.
- State selector.
- Measure toggle (Profit / Sales).
